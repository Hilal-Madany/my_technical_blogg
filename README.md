# Designing a Continuous Stress Relieving Furnace: A Case Study

Designing a continuous stress relieving furnace for cylinders is a complex task that demands careful consideration of various factors. This case study provides valuable insights into the design and specifications of such a furnace, utilizing LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) as the fuel source. While this article serves as a comprehensive guide, it's important to remember that furnace design should always adhere to industry standards and safety regulations.

## Step 1: Furnace Dimensions and Layout

The first consideration in designing a stress relieving furnace is its size and layout. In our case, we have a furnace with the following dimensions:

- Length: 20 feet
- Width: 6 feet

This results in a total hearth area of 120 square feet. The layout includes four burners, with two burners on each side, and it is divided into two zones, each with two burners.

## Step 2: Fuel Selection and Combustion Analysis

Choosing the right fuel for your furnace is crucial. In this project, we opted for LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) as the fuel source. To determine the gas requirements, we calculated the total connected load, which amounted to 2,400,000 BTU/hr (British Thermal Units per hour). Each burner requires 200 cubic feet of LPG. To facilitate this, we converted LPG to PNG (pipeline natural gas), resulting in approximately 366 cubic feet of PNG per burner.

## Step 3: Air Requirements and Burner Selection

Proper combustion requires the right amount of air. We calculated that each burner needs 6,000 cubic feet per hour (cfh) of air. For two burners in one zone, this totals 12,000 cfh. The selected pipe size for air is 4 inches in diameter, with a 3-inch disc cap to ensure adequate airflow.

## Step 4: Pressure and Blower Selection

Maintaining the correct combustion air pressure is essential for efficient furnace operation. We determined a combustion air pressure (P2) of 29.65 inches water gauge (wg). To meet this requirement, we chose a 2-inch safety ball valve (SBV) for combustion air and a 1/4-inch gas connection. For the pressure blower, we selected one with a capacity of 40 inches wg and an airflow requirement of 480 cubic feet per minute (cfm).

## Step 5: Control Valves and Safety Measures

To control the furnace's operation efficiently, we installed zone control valves, with one valve for each set of two burners in a zone. Additionally, we incorporated safety measures such as waste burner valves (WBV) with 3-inch reducing ports to ensure safe and controlled gas flow.

## Conclusion

Designing a continuous stress relieving furnace is a complex process that involves careful consideration of dimensions, fuel selection, air requirements, pressure control, and safety measures. The case study discussed here provides an overview of the key steps and decisions involved in designing such a furnace, with a focus on a specific example that utilizes LPG as the fuel source.

It's essential to emphasize that furnace design should always adhere to industry standards and safety regulations. Consultation with experts in furnace design and installation is highly recommended to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the system.
