Designing a Continuous Stress-Relieving Furnace: A Case Study

A Journey into Furnace Design with Nature's Guidance


Introduction

Designing a continuous stress-relieving furnace for cylinders is a complex, intricate task, much like the way nature carefully shapes and nurtures its creations. This case study serves as a guiding light into the world of furnace design, where we harness the power of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) as our energy source. While we embark on this journey, let us remember that the design process must always harmonize with industry standards and safety regulations, much like nature adheres to its own laws.

Step 1: Furnace Dimensions and Layout

In our quest to design a stress-relieving furnace, the dimensions and layout form our foundation. Picture a serene landscape where our furnace spans:

Length: 20 feet
Width: 6 feet

With this canvas, we create a total hearth area of 120 square feet, much akin to how nature crafts its ecosystems. Four burners, two on each side, stand as sentinels, and we divide our creation into two zones, each with two burners, resembling the balance of nature.

Step 2: Fuel Selection and Combustion Analysis

Selecting our fuel is like choosing the elements of nature to power our creation. Here, we embrace LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). Our calculations reveal a connected load of 2,400,000 BTU/hr, each burner demanding 200 cubic feet of LPG, akin to how nature calculates its resources. We transform LPG into PNG (pipeline natural gas), crafting approximately 366 cubic feet of PNG per burner.

Step 3: Air Requirements and Burner Selection

Just as nature breathes life into its creations, our furnace needs the right amount of air for proper combustion. A poetic calculation reveals each burner's thirst for 6,000 cubic feet per hour (CFH) of air. Two burners in one zone create harmony, totalling 12,000 CFH. Our pipe size, a humble 4-inch diameter, ensures a gentle flow, much like a gentle breeze in nature. A 3-inch disc cap dances in the wind, ensuring optimal airflow.

Step 4: Pressure and Blower Selection

Nature maintains balance, and so does our furnace. A combustion air pressure (P2) of 29.65 inches water gauge (WG) graces our creation. We select a 2-inch safety ball valve (SBV) for combustion air, mirroring nature's precision. A 1/4-inch gas connection hums with efficiency. Our pressure blower, with a capacity of 40 inches WG, echoes the power of the elements, with an airflow requirement of 480 cubic feet per minute (cfm).
Step 5: Control Valves and Safety Measures

Safety, the guardian of our furnace, stands tall. Zone control valves, much like watchful guardians, oversee the operation, with one valve for every pair of burners in a zone. Our safety measures, like the guardians of the forest, include waste burner valves (WBV) with 3-inch reducing ports, ensuring the gentle flow of gas, guided by nature's wisdom.

Conclusion

Our journey to design a continuous stress-relieving furnace mirrors the intricate dance of nature's elements. From dimensions to fuel selection, air requirements, pressure control, and safety measures, we find our inspiration in nature's harmony. As we conclude, remember that furnace design, like nature's laws, should always respect industry standards and safety regulations. Consulting with experts in furnace design and installation ensures the safe and efficient operation of this creation, crafted with nature's blessings.
